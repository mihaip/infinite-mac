# Infinite Mac

80's, 90's and early 2000s classic Macs that load instantly in a browser and have access to a large software library. The full collection is at [infinitemac.org](https://infinitemac.org). Shortcuts are available for [System 6](https://system6.app/), [System 7](https://system7.app/), [Mac OS 8](https://macos8.app/), [Mac OS 9](https://macos9.app/) and [KanjiTalk](https://kanjitalk7.app) (Japanese). For a high-level overview and the backstory, see [the launch blog post](https://blog.persistent.info/2022/03/blog-post.html) and [subsequent ones](https://blog.persistent.info/search/label/Infinite%20Mac).

## Development

This project uses Git LFS. Ensure that the LFS tooling is [installed](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) before cloning the repo.

This project uses submodules, use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac.git` to clone it (or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you have an existing checkout).

Common development tasks, all done via `npm run`:

-   `start`: Run local dev server (will be running at http://localhost:3127). Requires [dependencies](#dependencies) being installed and built.
-   `import-emulator <emulator>`: Copy generated WebAssembly from an emulator submodule (only necessary if modifying the emulator cores, see [below](#building-the-emulators) for how to rebuild them). The following emulators are supported:
    -   `basiliskii`: Basilisk II from https://github.com/mihaip/macemu
    -   `sheepshaver`: SheepShaver from https://github.com/mihaip/macemu
    -   `minivmac-Plus` (and others): Mini vMac variants from https://github.com/mihaip/minivmac
    -   `dingusppc`: DingusPPC from https://github.com/mihaip/dingusppc
    -   `previous`: Previous from https://github.com/mihaip/previous
    -   `pearpcc`: PearPC from https://github.com/mihaip/pearpc
-   `import-disks`: Build disk images for serving. Copies base OS images for the above emulators, and imports other software (found in `Library/`) into an "Infinite HD" disk image. Chunks disk images and generates a manifest for serving. This requires the macOS versions of Mini vMac and Basilisk II to be installed, since they are used as part of the image building process. Note that both Mini vMac and Basilisk II will be launched as part of this process. Once they seem done and you can see Infinite HD, Shut Down the emulated machine and then quit the respective emulator so that the task can continue.
-   `import-cd-roms`: Build CD-ROM library (actual CD-ROMs are hosted on archive.org and other sites, the library contains metadata)
-   `import-library`: Build downloads library (actual downloads are hosted on macintoshgarden.org and other sites, the library contains metadata)

Common deployment tasks (also done via `npm run`)

-   `build`: Rebuild for either local use (in the `build/` directory) or for Cloudflare Worker use
-   `preview`: Serve built assets locally using Vite's server (will be running at https://localhost:4127)
-   `worker-dev`: Preview built assets in a local Cloudflare Worker (requires a separate `build` invocation, result will be running at http://localhost:3128)
-   `worker-deploy`: Deploy built assets to the live version of the Cloudflare Worker (requires a separate `build` invocation)
-   `sync-disks`: Sync disk images to a Cloudflare R2 bucket. Should be done after disks are rebuilt with `import-disks` (and before `worker-deploy`).

### Dependencies

Dependencies can be installed with the following instructions. Feel free to skip the last `rclone` line if youâ€™re not planning to deploy the site.

```
npm install
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
npm run build-tools
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Supporting data files need to be generated.

Build the system boot disks and Infinite HD disk image:

```
npm run import-disks
```

Load metadata for the CD-ROM library:

```
npm run import-cd-roms
```

Load metadata for the [Macintosh Garden](https://macintoshgarden.org/) library. If you do not have a local copy of the library dump, you can use `placeholder` as the path to to generate a placeholder instead:

```
npm run import-library path/to/library/dump
```

### Building the emulators

Basilisk II, SheepShaver, Mini vMac and DingusPPC are the original 68K and PowerPC emulators that enable this project. They are hosted in [separate](https://github.com/mihaip/minivmac/) [repos](https://github.com/mihaip/macemu/) and are included via Git submodules. Rebuilding them is only required when making changes to the emulator core, the generated files are in `src/emulator` and included in the Git repository.

To begin, ensure that you have a Docker image built with the Emscripten toolchain and supporting libraries:

```sh
docker build -t macemu_emsdk .
```

Open a shell into the Docker container:

```sh
scripts/docker-shell.sh
```

Once in that container, you can use a couple of helper scripts to build them:

#### Basilisk II

```sh
cd /macemu/BasiliskII/src/Unix
# Bootstrap Basilisk II, to generate the CPU emulator code
./_embootstrap.sh
# Switch into building for WASM
./_emconfigure.sh
# Actually compile Basilisk II targeting WASM
make -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator basiliskii` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.

#### SheepShaver

```sh
cd /macemu/SheepShaver/src/Unix
# Configure for building for WASM
./_emconfigure.sh
# Actually compile SheepShaver targeting WASM
make -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator sheepshaver` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.

#### Mini vMac

See [this page](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/options.html) for the full set set of build options (and [this one](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/develop.html) for more estoeric ones).

```sh
cd /minivmac
# Configure for building for WASM
./emscripten_setup.sh
# This configures the Mac Plus model by default, alternative outputs can be
# configured with additional arguments:
# - `-m 128K -speed z`: Mac 128K (uses 1x speed by default to be more realistic)
# - `-m 512Ke`: Mac 512ke
# - `-m SE`: Mac SE
# - `-m II`: Mac II
# Actually compile Mini vMac targeting WASM
make -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator minivmac-<model>` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.

### DingusPPC

```sh
cd /dingusppc
mkdir -p build
cd build
emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make dingusppc -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator dingusppc` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.

### Previous

```sh
cd /previous
mkdir -p build
cd build
emcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_RENDERING_THREAD=0 ..
make previous -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator previous` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.

### PearPC

```sh
cd /pearpc
# Configure for building for WASM
./_emconfigure.sh
# Actually compile PearPC targeting WASM
make -j8
```

Once it has built, use `npm run import-emulator pearpc` from the host to update the files in `src/emulator`.
